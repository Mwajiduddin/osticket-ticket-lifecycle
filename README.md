<h1>Introduction</h1>
In this section we will play around in osTicket and show the ticketing process. This part is more of a self-experimentation for you to explore the ticket process than a tutorial<br />

<h2>Walkthrough</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Creating a ticket as users</h3>

http://localhost/osTicket/ 

Using the link above, create a ticket, log in as one of the users you create in the previous tutorial, select one of the help topics you've made in the previous tutorial, fill in the blanks at your own discretion and hit "Create Ticket." You can then create another ticket as the other user by clicking on "Open a New Ticket" up top.

</p>

Now copy and paste the link at the bottom and log back in as the agent that you made in the previous tutorial and you'll see the tickets that you made are populated in the front page.

</p>


Click on one of the ticket you created and you'll see that you can change its status, priority, department, specifiy on who you want to assign it, SLA, and the ticket status. Remember: the reason why you can change so much paramaters is because in the previous tutorial we ticked off all the boxes in "Permissions" when creating our agent, Jane Doe.

You can resolve tickets by selecting "Resolved" from the drop-down menu next to "Ticket Status" and clicking on "Post Reply" then it will be in the "Closed" section and it will specify who closed the ticket.
