<h1>Introduction</h1>
This tutorial we will play around in osTicket and show examples of the ticketing process.<br />


<h2>Tutorial Guideline</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Creating a ticket as users</h3>

http://localhost/osTicket/ 

Using the link above, create a ticket, log in as one of the users you create in the previous tutorial, select "Business Critical Outage" as the help topic, fill in the blanks at your own discretion and hit "Create Ticket." Then create another ticket as the other user by clicking on "Create a new ticket" up top.

Now copy and paste the link at the bottom and log back in as the agent that you made in the previous tutorial and you'll see the tickets that you made are populated in the front page.

http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php

Click on one of the ticket you created and you'll see that you can change its status, priority, department, specifiy on who you want to assign it, SLA, and the ticket status. You can resolve tickets by selecting "Resolved" from the drop-down menu next to "Ticket Status" and it will be in the "Closed" section and it specify who closed it.
